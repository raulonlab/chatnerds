## youtube.sources

Copy and paste the following urls in `nerds/stoicism/youtube.sources`. By default, the tool only downloads the audio of the latest 30 videos of playlists and channels. I've commented out the playlists with more than 100 videos because it takes a long time to download them. You can uncomment them if you want.
