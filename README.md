# [ChatNerds](https://github.com/raulonlab/chatnerds)

Yet another CLI tool to Q&A with your documents, also including YouTube videos and podcasts, using local LLMs and RAG (Retrieval-augmented generation) techniques. This is my personal project to learn about LLM and RAG

## Introduction

Chatnerds allows you to create and manage "nerds", each one with its own configuration and set of documents. The idea of a nerd is to be an expert in a specific subject. You can create as many nerd as you want, but can only work with one at a time.

## How to install?

- Requires python >=3.10
- Create an environment (recommended)
- Install package and CLI app:
```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/raulonlab/chatnerds.git
```

Or clone the repo and install it in development mode using poetry:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/raulonlab/chatnerds.git
poetry install
poetry shell
```

## How to Use?

```bash
chatnerds --help
```

```

```

### Create and manage nerds

Create a new nerd:
```bash
chatnerds init nerd_name
```
> The first time, it will create a new directory `nerds` in the current path to store the nerds data.

The following files will be created in the nerds folder:

```
üìÅ nerds/
‚îú‚îÄ üìÅ nerd_name/
‚îÇ  ‚îú‚îÄ üìÅ downloads/          // <-- audios downloaded from youtube and podcasts
‚îÇ  ‚îú‚îÄ üìÅ source_documents/   // <-- source documents to ingest (pdf, txt, etc)
‚îÇ  ‚îú‚îÄ üìÑ config.yml          // <-- LLM and RAG configuration of the nerd
‚îÇ  ‚îú‚îÄ üìÑ podcast.sources     // <-- source podcast URLs (XML feed)
‚îÇ  ‚îú‚îÄ üìÑ youtube.sources     // <-- source youtube URLs (channel, playlist or video)
```

Activate a nerd:
```bash
chatnerds activate nerd_name
```

This writes the environment variable `ACTIVE_NERD=nerd_name` in the file `.chatnerds.env` which is loaded by the application when it runs. 

You can also `list`, `rename` and `remove` nerds.

### Add sources

Nerds can ingest information from these 3 sources:

- **Document files in the directory `source_documents/`**. The supported formats with the loader class (from Langchain) used are the following:
	- `".pdf"`: PDFMinerLoader,
	- `".epub"`: UnstructuredEPubLoader,
	- `".md"`: UnstructuredMarkdownLoader,
	- `".txt"`: TextLoader,
	- `".doc"`: UnstructuredWordDocumentLoader,
	- `".docx"`: UnstructuredWordDocumentLoader,
	- `".enex"`: EverNoteLoader,
	- `".csv"`: CSVLoader,
	- `".html"`: UnstructuredHTMLLoader,
	- `".odt"`: UnstructuredODTLoader,
	- `".ppt"`: UnstructuredPowerPointLoader,
	- `".pptx"`: UnstructuredPowerPointLoader,

- **Youtube URLs in the file `youtube.sources`**: Links to videos, playlists and channels are supported. One url per line. Lines starting with `#` are ignored.
- **Podcast URLs in the file `podcast.sources`**: Links to XML feeds are supported. One url per line. Lines starting with `#` are ignored.

For the Youtube and podcast sources it's necessary to download the audio and transcribe the audio into text files in order to be ready to ingest.

### Download and transcribe Youtube and podcast sources

![Study diagram](docs/download-transcribe.png)

Start downloading the audio files (.mp3) of the youtube and podcast sources:
```bash
chatnerds download-sources
```
> Audio files are saved in `downloads/youtube/` and `downloads/podcasts/` organised by channel / author name

Start transcribing the audio files from the downloads directory into transcript files (.transcript):
```bash
chatnerds transcribe-downloads
```
> Transcript files are saved in `source_documents/youtube/` and `source_documents/podcasts/` with the same directory structure than audio files in the downloads directory

### Study documents

![Study diagram](docs/study.png)

Start studying (also known as ingesting) the documents in `source_documents/`:

```bash
chatnerds study
```
> Processed documents are stored in a Chroma vector database whose data files are placed in a subdirectory `db` of the nerd directory. The first time using a new sentence transformer model, it will download the model files and might take a while

For each document, the study process does the following steps:
- Load the document using a Langchain loader
- Split the document in big chunks and small chunks. Small chunks are used for retrieval / similarity searches. Big chunks (or parent chunks) are the ones included as a context in the prompt sent to the LLM
- Calculate the embeddings of the chunks using the sentence transformer model
- Store the document, big chunks, small chunks and embeddings in the local DB

Documents already processed and stored in the database are skipped

### Chat

![Chat chain diagram](docs/chat_chain.png)

Start chatting with your active nerd in interactive mode:
```bash
chatnerds chat
```

or send the question straight away:
```bash
chatnerds chat "..."
```

> The first time using a new LLM model, it will download the model files and might take a while

### Nerd configuration

The file `config.yml` in the nerd directory allows to override the default model settings used by the nerd. See the default configuration (with annotations) in [chatnerds/config.yml](chatnerds/config.yml). The new configuration is applied on every command. 

> Note that changing some of the configuration, like `embeddings` and `chroma`, will invalidate the current embeddings added in the database. To fix it, delete the directory `./nerds/nerd_name/db` and start again

## Configuration with environment variables

The general behaviour of the application can be configured with environment variables or reading them from a `.env` file in the current path (optional). 

Print the current value of environment variables:
```bash
chatnerds env
```

Or print the default value of environment variables defined initially by the application (it will be the same than the current values if no .env file present)
```bash
chatnerds env --default
```

The available variables with their default values are:

```bash
LOG_FILE_LEVEL=NOTSET  # (Default: NOTSET) Logging level for the log file. Values: INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL, NOTSET. If None, disable logging to file
LOG_FILE_PATH=logs/chatnerds.log  # (Default: "logs/chatnerds.log") Path to log file
VERBOSE=1  # (Default: 1) Amount of logs written to stdout (0: none, 1: medium, 2: full)

# transcription (Whisper) options
WHISPER_TRANSCRIPTION_MODEL_NAME=base  # (Default: "base") Name of the model to use for transcribing audios: tiny, base, small, medium, large
TRANSCRIPT_ADD_SUMMARY=False  # (Default: False) Include a summary of the transcription in the output file

# youtube download options
YOUTUBE_GROUP_BY_AUTHOR=True  # (Default: True) Group downloaded videos by channel
YOUTUBE_SLEEP_SECONDS_BETWEEN_DOWNLOADS=3  # (Default: 3) Number of seconds to sleep between downloads
YOUTUBE_ADD_DATE_PREFIX=True  # (Default: True) Prefix all episodes with an ISO8602 formatted date of when they were published. Useful to ensure chronological ordering
YOUTUBE_SLUGIFY_PATHS=True  # (Default: True) Clean all folders and filename of potentially weird characters that might cause trouble with one or another target filesystem
YOUTUBE_MAXIMUM_EPISODE_COUNT=30  # (Default: 30) Only download the given number of episodes per youtube channel. Useful if you don't really need the entire backlog. Set 0 to disable limit

# podcast download options
PODCAST_UPDATE_ARCHIVE=True  # (Default: True) Force the archiver to only update the feeds with newly added episodes. As soon as the first old episode found in the download directory, further downloading is interrupted
PODCAST_ADD_DATE_PREFIX=True  # (Default: True) Prefix all episodes with an ISO8602 formatted date of when they were published. Useful to ensure chronological ordering
PODCAST_SLUGIFY_PATHS=True  # (Default: True) Clean all folders and filename of potentially weird characters that might cause trouble with one or another target filesystem
PODCAST_GROUP_BY_AUTHOR=True  # (Default: True) Create a subdirectory for each feed (named with their titles) and put the episodes in there
PODCAST_MAXIMUM_EPISODE_COUNT=30  # (Default: 30) Only download the given number of episodes per podcast feed. Useful if you don't really need the entire backlog. Set 0 to disable limit
PODCAST_SHOW_PROGRESS_BAR=True  # (Default: True) Show a progress bar while downloading
```

The application also saves certain runtime settings in the file `.chatnerds.env` (for example, the active nerd). It's not necessary to touch this file since is handled automatically by the application.
